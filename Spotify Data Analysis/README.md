3. Determine the artist listed in the 18th position.
4. Calculate the correlation between two variables.
5. Explore the relationship between Loudness and Energy.
6. Examine the connection between Popularity and Acousticness.
7. Analyze the distribution of the total number of songs per year.
8. Investigate the duration of songs over the years.
9. Calculate the average duration of songs per year.
