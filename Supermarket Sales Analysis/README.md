## SQL Project: Supermarket Sales Analysis

### Overview:
In this project, I utilized MySQL Workbench to analyze extensive sales data from a supermarket. The objective was to gain insights into various aspects of the sales, including revenue generation, top-selling branches, customer segmentation, popular products, payment methods, and sales trends.

### Tools used:
- SQL
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench

### Analysis:
1. **Total Revenue Calculation:** Calculated the total revenue generated from the sales data in the table.
```
SELECT SUM(Total) AS total_revenue
FROM sales;
```
2. **Top-Selling Branch Identification:** Identified the branch (city) with the highest total sales revenue.
```
SELECT Branch, City, SUM(Total) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY Branch, City
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
3. **Customer Segmentation by Type:** Determined the number of sales made to members and normal customers.
```
SELECT Customer_type, COUNT(*) AS num_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY Customer_type;
```
4. **Top Gross Income Generating Product Line:** Identified the product line that generated the highest gross income and its total.
```
SELECT Product_line, SUM(gross_income) AS total_gross_income
FROM sales
GROUP BY Product_line
ORDER BY total_gross_income DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
5. **Average Unit Price by Branch:** Calculated the average unit price of products sold in each branch.
```
SELECT Branch, City, AVG(Unit_price) AS avg_unit_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY Branch, City;
```
6. **Most Popular Payment Method:** Identified the most popular payment method among customers.
```
SELECT Payment, COUNT(*) AS num_payments
FROM sales
GROUP BY Payment
ORDER BY num_payments DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
7. **Average Gross Margin Percentage by Product Line:** Calculated the average gross margin percentage for each product line.
```
SELECT Product_line, AVG(gross_margin_percentage) AS avg_margin_percentage
FROM sales
GROUP BY Product_line;
```
8. **Day with Highest Sales Volume:** Determined the day of the week with the highest sales volume.
```
SELECT IFNULL(DAYNAME(Date), 'Unknown') AS day_of_week, COUNT(*) AS num_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY DAYNAME(Date), Date
ORDER BY num_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
9. **Total Quantity Sold by Product Line:** Calculated the total quantity sold for each product line.
```
SELECT Product_line, SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY Product_line;
```
10. **Total Tax Amount Collected by Gender:** Calculated the total tax amount collected for each gender.
```
SELECT Gender, SUM(COALESCE(`Tax_5%`, 0)) AS total_tax_amount
FROM sales
GROUP BY Gender;
```
