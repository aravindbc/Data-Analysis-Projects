### Overview
This project centers on the analysis of water quality, specifically water potability. We'll utilize a Kaggle dataset to examine the factors influencing water quality and classify water samples as safe or unfit for consumption. The objective is to ensure access to safe drinking water, aligning with fundamental human rights and contributing to water quality research.

### Technologies Used
- Python - pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Analysis
1. Distribution of 0 and 1 in the Potability column
2. Distribution of ph
3. Distribution of water hardness
4. Distribution of total dissolved solids in water
5. Distribution of chloramine in water
6. Distribution of sulfate in water
7. Distribution of water conductivity
8. Distribution of organic carbon in water
9. Distribution of trihalomethanes or THMs in water
10. Distribution of turbidity in water
