### Overview
The "Covid-19 Data Analysis" project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Covid-19 cases and vaccination data in India using Python. The project aims to uncover insights from the datasets to provide a better understanding of the pandemic's impact.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Python Libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly are required for data manipulation and visualization.
- Covid-19 in India Dataset: The dataset containing Covid-19 cases and vaccination data specific to India. This dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle or a similar source.

### Steps
1. **Import Dataset Using pandas**: In a Jupyter Notebook or Python script, use the read_csv() function from the pandas library to load the data from the CSV file into your working environment.
2. **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Utilize various Python libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.) to clean and analyze the Covid-19 and vaccination datasets. Explore data, perform calculations, and generate insights through code.
3. **Data Visualization**: Utilize libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to create visualizations that provide a clear representation of the Covid-19 and vaccination trends in India.
