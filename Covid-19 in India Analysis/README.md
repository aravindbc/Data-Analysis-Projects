### Overview
The "Covid-19 Data Analysis" project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Covid-19 cases and vaccination data in India using Python. The project aims to uncover insights from the datasets to provide a better understanding of the pandemic's impact.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language utilized for data analysis and visualization.
- **Python Libraries**: Libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly are required for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Covid-19 in India Dataset**: The dataset containing Covid-19 cases and vaccination data specific to India. This dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle or a similar source.

### Steps
1. **Download and Extract the Dataset**: Download the Covid-19 in India dataset from Kaggle or an appropriate source, and extract it to a suitable location on your computer.
2. **Import Dataset Using pandas**: In a Jupyter Notebook or Python script, use the read_csv() function from the pandas library to load the data from the CSV file into your working environment.
3. **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Utilize various Python libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.) to clean and analyze the Covid-19 and vaccination datasets. Explore data, perform calculations, and generate insights through code.
4. **Data Visualization**: Utilize libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to create visualizations that provide a clear representation of the Covid-19 and vaccination trends in India.
