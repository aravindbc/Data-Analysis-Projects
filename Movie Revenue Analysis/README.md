## Movie Revenue Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I used a 'Movie Revenue' dataset to create a Microsoft Excel dashboard. I focused on improving data presentation, performing various metric calculations, generating visuals, and extracting insights from the movie revenue data.

### Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel

### Steps
1. Calculate Column and Row Totals.
2. Compute Average, Min, and Max for key metrics.
3. Calculate Month over Month changes for the latest month.
4. Apply conditional formatting to the Month over Month column.
5. Sort data by Totals in descending order.
6. Add an "above average" or "below average" column based on Total value.
7. Introduce a Distributor information column next to the movie.
8. Create a Pivot Table displaying sum and average values for distributors.
9. Generate a horizontal bar chart for totals by Movie.
10. Create a vertical bar chart for average values by Genre.
11. Produce a pie chart for average values by Distributor.

### Key Insights
- The drama genre garners the highest average revenue of $320,106.
- Paramount Pictures garnered the highest average revenue of $594,519.
- "Transformers" is the highest total revenue-earning movie on the list.
